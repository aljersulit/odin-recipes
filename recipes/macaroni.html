		<h2>Creamy Macaroni Salad: A Refreshing Side Dish</h2>
		<p>
			This creamy macaroni salad is a refreshing and delicious side dish,
			perfect for picnics, barbecues, or as a light lunch. Elbow macaroni
			is combined with crisp vegetables like celery, bell peppers, and
			onions, then tossed in a tangy, creamy dressing. The salad is
			chilled for a few hours to allow the flavors to meld together,
			making it a great make-ahead dish.
