		<h2>Classic Italian Lasagna: Layers of Flavor and Tradition</h2>
		<p>
			Lasagna is a hearty Italian dish made by layering wide pasta sheets
			with a rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and plenty of cheese. The
			sauce typically consists of ground beef or sausage, simmered with
			onions, garlic, tomatoes, and Italian herbs like basil and oregano,
			creating a savory depth of flavor. Between each layer of pasta, the
			sauce is generously spread, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce or
			ricotta cheese, which adds a smooth and creamy texture. Mozzarella
			and Parmesan cheese are sprinkled throughout, ensuring every bite is
			cheesy and satisfying. Baked to golden perfection, lasagna is a
			comforting meal perfect for family gatherings or cozy dinners.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 lb (450g) ground beef or Italian sausage (or a mix)</li>
			<li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
			<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
			<li>1 can (15 oz) tomato sauce or tomato paste</li>
			<li>1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes (optional)</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste (if not using a canned sauce)</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity)</li>

			<li>16 oz (450g) ricotta cheese or cottage cheese</li>
			<li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
			<li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
			<li>1 egg (optional, to bind the cheese)</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley or basil (chopped)</li>

			<li>12 lasagna noodles (boiled, unless using no-boil noodles)</li>

			<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>2 cups milk</li>
			<li>Pinch of nutmeg (optional)</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

			<li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (extra for topping)</li>
			<li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (for topping)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>

			<li>
				In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped
				onions and garlic, and sauté until softened, about 3-5 minutes.
			</li>

			<li>
				Add the ground beef or sausage to the pan. Cook until browned,
				breaking it up into small pieces with a spoon. Drain any excess
				fat.
			</li>

			<li>
				Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste (if using),
				diced tomatoes (optional), basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and
				sugar (optional). Stir to combine and let the sauce simmer for
				20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
			</li>

			<li>
				While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according
				to package instructions, or prepare no-boil noodles if using.
				Drain and set aside.
			</li>

			<li>
				In a bowl, mix the ricotta cheese (or cottage cheese) with one
				egg, parsley (or basil), and half of the Parmesan cheese. Stir
				until well combined.
			</li>

			<li>
				If using béchamel sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over
				medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes until
				lightly golden. Slowly whisk in the milk and cook until the
				sauce thickens. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, then
				remove from heat.
			</li>

			<li>
				Assemble the lasagna: In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin
				layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Add a layer of lasagna
				noodles on top of the sauce.
			</li>

			<li>
				Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture or béchamel sauce
				over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce, and a
				sprinkling of mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers (noodles,
				ricotta or béchamel, meat sauce, mozzarella) until all
				ingredients are used, finishing with a final layer of sauce and
				mozzarella cheese.
			</li>

			<li>Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan cheese on top.</li>

			<li>
				Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25
				minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25
				minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden brown.
			</li>

			<li>
				Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and
				serving.
			</li>
