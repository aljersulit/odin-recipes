# Odin Recipes

This project is for The Odin Project Foundation Course. A simple recipe website created with pure HTML that demonstrates what I learned from the course.
From getting familiar with the different HTML elements and tags to writing semantic HTML why they are important, and the purpose of attributes. Writing good commit messages, how to write them, when to commit, and why having a history of good commits is so important.
